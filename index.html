    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>Hey there, <br />
        <br />
        I'm a high school student with a love for coding that started when I was just 16. It began as a school project, but quickly turned into a passion project. Now, at 17, I'm fully immersed in web development, eager to learn and grow every day. <br />
        <br />
        School's always been important to me, and I'm proud to say I'm maintaining a 95+ average. But beyond the classroom, I've also dabbled in competitive programming and math competitions, even earning distinctions from the CEMC. <br />
        <br />
        Chess has been a big part of my life too. In 10th grade, I hit a peak rating of 1850. Chess isn't just a game to me; it's taught me strategy, analysis, and resilience â€“ skills I bring to every aspect of my life. <br />
        <br />
        Now, I'm diving into full-stack development, with a solid grasp of C++. I believe my early start in web development, academic achievements, competitive spirit from chess, and coding competition experience give me a unique edge. I'm not just another candidate; I bring a blend of skills, passion, and determination that sets me apart. <br />
        <br />
        I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and eager to bring my skills to the table in the world of software development. <br />
        <br /> 
        Let's build something awesome together. <br />
        <br />
        Cheers, <br />
